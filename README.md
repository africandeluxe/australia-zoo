# Australian Zoo

Built the Australia Zoo activity as a multi page React website.

My knowledge of project design, state, props, components and routing were examined. The design was somewhat up to me, but the structure of the pages was detailed.

The local Zoo is hosting an exhibition of Australian animals and want to raise awareness by publishing a website.
